      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        When we talk about creating digital products, two terms are often mentioned together: 
        <strong>UI (User Interface)</strong> and <strong>UX (User Experience)</strong>. While these terms are closely related, 
        they refer to different aspects of design. Together, they ensure that a product is both beautiful to look at and easy to use.

          <strong>User Interface (UI)</strong> refers to the visual and interactive elements of a product. 
          It focuses on aesthetics, such as the layout, color scheme, typography, and buttons, that users engage with directly.
          A well-designed UI enhances user satisfaction by providing an intuitive and visually appealing environment.

      <h2>Key Differences Between UI and UX</h2>

        While UI and UX often overlap, they serve distinct purposes. Here's a side-by-side comparison:
      </p>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Aspect</th>

            <th>UX (User Experience)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        UI and UX are two sides of the same coin. While UI focuses on the appearance, UX is about the experience. 
        Together, they ensure that a product is not only functional but also enjoyable to use. Understanding their interplay is key to creating successful designs.
